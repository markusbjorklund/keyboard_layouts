## QWERTY ##
These are my keyboardlayouts that I use on my keyboard builds. Have added all of them to git to keep them up to date as I am flashing both from Mac and PC.  Almost all of the layouts are used in Nordic ISO. 

Feel free to use them and change them for your own project.

Happy clacking and clicking!
